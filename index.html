   <p><p>I love to start of my morning with coffee. My favorite is a salted maple latte. The maple adds the perfect amount of sweetness and the salt is a nice constrast. There are also times that I like to have a flat white. When I have a flat white, I enjoy the lovely balance of milk and expresso. My choice usually depends on my mood. With either choice, I enjoy it most when I have the time to sit down and appreciate my coffee.</p></p>
